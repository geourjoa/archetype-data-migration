# Legacy Source To Current Schema Migration Plan

This document explains the transition from a restored legacy source database to
the current Archetype backend target schema. Database names are environment
specific; use `LEGACY_DATABASE_URL` and `TARGET_DATABASE_URL` for real runs.

It is paired with the read-only audit command:

```bash
./scripts/backend-compose-run.sh python -m commands.audit_legacy_migration \
  --format markdown \
  --output reports/legacy-migration-audit.md
```

The command validates the live databases without writing to either one. The
checked-in audit snapshot is [legacy-migration-audit.md](legacy-migration-audit.md).

For deployment planning, trial imports, and future production migration work,
use the generated operator guide and manifest template:

- [operator-guide.md](operator-guide.md)
- [legacy-migration-manifest-template.json](../manifests/legacy-migration-manifest-template.json)

Regenerate them with:

```bash
just procedure
```

To include a live read-only audit summary in the guide, run:

```bash
just procedure-live
```

## Current Comparison Summary

Snapshot: 2026-06-09.

| Database | Public tables | Shape |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Legacy source database | 142 | Legacy Digipal/Mezzanine/South-era schema. |
| Target database | 52 | Current Django app schema. |

The current target is clearly a selective migration, not a full clone:

- Core manuscript, scribe, symbol, image, annotation, text, and publication
  entities were migrated.
- New current-only workflow and product tables exist in the target:
  `common_editevent`, `manuscripts_statustransition`, and `worksets_workset`.
- Current-only derived metadata exists for date assessments in
  `manuscripts_historicalitemdateassessment`.
- Many legacy support tables were intentionally retired: request logs,
  revisions, South migration history, old page/forms/twitter/gallery tables,
  permissions, ratings, and empty legacy vocabularies.
- Most domain entity ids were preserved.
- A few target placeholder rows can be introduced with negative ids, notably
  `-1` item part and scribe. Symbol placeholders must be source-policy driven;
  the importer no longer assumes a hard-coded allograph character id.
- `common_date` keeps legacy ids but also has target-only seed rows `1` to
  `16`.
- Some join tables were re-keyed in the target because they became explicit
  through-models or tagulous tables.

## Entity Mapping

| Legacy entity | Current entity | Migration status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `digipal_date` | `common_date` | Id-preserved, with target-only seed dates `1` to `16`. |
| none | `common_editevent` | Target-only append-only edit log; do not import from legacy. |
| `digipal_format` | `manuscripts_itemformat` | Direct/id-preserved. |
| `digipal_source` | `manuscripts_bibliographicsource` | Direct/id-preserved. |
| `digipal_repository` | `manuscripts_repository` | Id-preserved; place/type denormalised. Blank labels need explicit fallbacks. |
| `digipal_currentitem` | `manuscripts_currentitem` | Id-preserved; shelfmarks/descriptions transformed. |
| `digipal_historicalitem` | `manuscripts_historicalitem` | Id-preserved; type/language/hair/date lookups flattened. |
| target date metadata | `manuscripts_historicalitemdateassessment` | Target-only derived metadata, currently 22 rows. |
| `digipal_description` | `manuscripts_historicalitemdescription` | Id-preserved; `description` becomes `content`. |
| `digipal_cataloguenumber` | `manuscripts_cataloguenumber` | Id-preserved; `source_id` becomes `catalogue_id`. |
| `digipal_itempart` plus `digipal_itempartitem` | `manuscripts_itempart` | Id-preserved from item part; target has synthetic `-1`. Historical link comes from `digipal_itempartitem`. |
| `digipal_image` | `manuscripts_itemimage` | Id-preserved; image path/IIIF fields transformed. |
| Non-empty `digipal_text_textcontentxml` | `manuscripts_imagetext` | Content-preserved; ids not preserved. Empty XML rows are excluded. Current review fields and `content_dpt_legacy` are target-side additions. |
| none | `manuscripts_statustransition` | Target-only image-text review workflow log; do not import from legacy. |
| `digipal_scribe` | `scribes_scribe` | Id-preserved; target has synthetic `-1`. |
| `digipal_script` | `scribes_script` | Direct/id-preserved; currently zero rows. |
| `digipal_hand` | `scribes_hand` | Id-preserved; legacy display fields collapse into target name/place/description. Current `num`, `priority`, and `is_default` drive ordering/default selection. |
| `digipal_hand_images` | `scribes_hand_item_part_images` | Direct/id-preserved. |
| `digipal_character` | `symbols_structure_character` | Id-preserved; ontograph/form data flattened into type. |
| `digipal_allograph` | `symbols_structure_allograph` | Id-preserved. Synthetic placeholders require an explicit source policy. |
| `digipal_component` | `symbols_structure_component` | Direct/id-preserved. |
| `digipal_feature` | `symbols_structure_feature` | Direct/id-preserved. |
| `digipal_component_features` | `symbols_structure_component_features` | Direct/id-preserved. |
| `digipal_allographcomponent` | `symbols_structure_allographcomponent` | Mostly id-preserved; legacy row `46` is absent in the inspected target. |
| `digipal_allographcomponent_features` | `symbols_structure_allographcomponentfeature` | Mostly id-preserved; legacy row `127` is absent in the inspected target. |
| `digipal_aspect` | `symbols_structure_position` | Id-preserved rename. |
| `digipal_allograph_aspects` | `symbols_structure_allographposition` | Re-keyed; row count preserved. |
| `digipal_annotation` plus `digipal_graph` | `annotations_graph` | Legacy annotation ids preserved; target may have documented current-only extra graph rows. Target `created` is current-side metadata. |
| `digipal_graphcomponent` | `annotations_graphcomponent` | Mostly preserved but filtered. |
| `digipal_graphcomponent_features` | `annotations_graphcomponent_features` | Mostly preserved but filtered. |
| `digipal_graph_aspects` | `annotations_graph_positions` | Re-keyed and filtered with graph rows; six fewer rows in the current target snapshot. |
| `blog_blogpost` | `publications_publication` | Id-preserved; author ids need special handling. |
| `blog_blogpost_categories` | `publications_publication_keywords` | Re-keyed through tagulous keywords. |
| `digipal_carouselitem` | `publications_carouselitem` | Id-preserved; field names transformed. |
| none | `worksets_workset` | Target-only user-saved lightbox/citable collection feature; currently empty. |

## Key Differences And Risks

### Publication Authors

Do not use legacy `auth_user.id` as the publication author key in a fresh
migration. The current target has seeded users in ids `1` to `5`, so migrated
publication rows that kept old author ids now resolve to different usernames
for several authors.

Safe future options:

- Create/map legacy users by username or email before importing publications.
- Or choose one explicit fallback author and record the original legacy author
  username in publication metadata or migration logs.

### Annotations

Legacy annotations are split across:

- `digipal_annotation`: image region, geo JSON, notes, text/editorial type.
- `digipal_graph`: graph classification, hand, idiograph.
- `digipal_idiograph`: allograph indirection.
- `digipal_graphcomponent`, `digipal_graphcomponent_features`,
  `digipal_graph_aspects`: selected components/features/aspects.

The target collapses much of this into `annotations_graph`, with separate
through tables for components/features/positions.

Observed audit facts:

- All 24,584 legacy annotation ids exist in `annotations_graph`.
- The inspected target has documented current-only extra annotation rows:
  `27336`, `27337`, and `27350`.
- Legacy has 20,535 graph-linked image annotations.
- Target has 20,537 `image` graph rows.
- Target has 24,587 total graph rows.
- Target text/editorial graph rows retain `allograph_id`/`hand_id` values.
  This is allowed by the database constraint, but it differs from the current
  model comment that treats those links as optional for text/editorial rows.
- Current target graph rows have `created` populated; legacy data has no
  equivalent creation timestamp.

### Image Text

Legacy text data lives in `digipal_text_textcontentxml`. The migration should
only import non-empty XML content.

Current counts:

- Legacy non-empty XML rows: 899.
- Target `manuscripts_imagetext` rows: 899.
- Empty draft rows are intentionally excluded.
- `review_assignee_id`, `StatusTransition`, and `content_dpt_legacy` are
  current workflow/TEI migration fields, not legacy source data.

### Current-Only Tables And Metadata

These target structures are valid target data but not legacy imports:

- `common_editevent`: 22 rows in the current snapshot.
- `manuscripts_historicalitemdateassessment`: 22 rows in the current snapshot,
  generated from current target date metadata.
- `manuscripts_statustransition`: 0 rows in the current snapshot.
- `worksets_workset`: 0 rows in the current snapshot.

For a fresh migration, create these through current application workflows or
target-side data migrations only when their source semantics are clear. Do not
manufacture them from legacy source tables without a separate product decision.

### Retired Legacy Tables

These categories should not be imported into the current schema unless a
product requirement reintroduces them:

- Logs/history: `digipal_requestlog`, `reversion_*`,
  `south_migrationhistory`, old `django_session` rows.
- Legacy CMS structures not represented in the current app:
  `pages_*`, `forms_*`, `galleries_*`, `twitter_*`.
- Empty or unsupported palaeographic/manuscript tables such as legacy
  collation, decoration, layout, owners, places, institutions, measurements,
  and provenance tables. Some have data, but there is no current model surface
  for them.
- Legacy permission/group assignments. Rebuild these in the current app
  instead of copying them.

## Safe Future Migration Procedure

Use Docker Compose throughout. Do not run backend database operations directly
against host Python.

1. Backup everything.
   - Dump the legacy database with `pg_dump --format=custom`.
   - Dump the target database before any trial migration.
   - Store both dumps outside the live Postgres volume.

2. Restore legacy side-by-side.
   - Restore legacy into any clearly named source database, then set
     `LEGACY_DATABASE_URL`.
   - Create a fresh target database from current Django migrations, then set
     `TARGET_DATABASE_URL` or `DATABASE_URL`.
   - Do not import into a target database with existing domain rows unless the
     task is explicitly an audit.

3. Run the read-only audit.
   - Use `audit_legacy_migration`.
   - Against a fresh empty target, expect `fail` because the audit compares
     source and target contents and the target does not contain the source rows
     yet. Preserve this report as the baseline; do not treat the expected
     missing-target results as proof that the source is invalid.
   - The baseline command can exit non-zero after successfully writing its
     report because audit status `fail` is represented as a failed process.
   - Investigate structural errors, missing required tables, connection errors,
     and unexpected source conditions before proceeding.
   - After an import, treat `fail` as a blocker.
   - Treat `warn` as requiring sign-off, because warnings identify intentional
     loss, placeholders, or transformed semantics.

4. Import in dependency order.
   - Users/authors or fallback author policy.
   - Core vocabularies: dates, formats, sources, repositories.
   - Symbol vocabularies: characters, allographs, components, features,
     positions.
   - Manuscript entities: current items, historical items, descriptions,
     catalogue numbers, item parts, images.
   - Scribes and hands.
   - Image text.
   - Annotations and graph through tables.
   - Publications, comments if any, carousel items, keywords.
   - Target-only workflow/product tables only after the migrated data is
     validated, and only from current-system sources.
   - The `migrate_legacy_data` command implements this order by default. It
     plans only unless `--execute` is passed.

5. Preserve ids where the audit says ids are preserved.
   - This keeps legacy URLs/references easier to reconcile.
   - Reset sequences after importing explicit ids.
   - Keep negative placeholder ids explicit and documented.

6. Validate after each phase.
   - Re-run `audit_legacy_migration`.
   - Check row counts and samples.
   - Check FK integrity.
   - Check target constraints.
   - Run focused application tests.

7. Rebuild derived systems.
   - Run migrations.
   - Run `just sync-sequences`.
   - Rebuild Meilisearch indexes with `just sync-all-search-indexes`.
   - For image text TEI work, keep `content_dpt_legacy` as the reversible
     source during the retention window.

8. Record an import manifest.
   - Legacy dump filename and checksum.
   - Target schema migration state.
   - Audit output.
   - Any accepted warnings.
   - Any rows intentionally skipped.

## Source Variability And Unsupported Rows

DigiPal databases can share a schema without sharing the same identifiers or
data profile. The checked-in map and audit describe the source snapshot that
was inspected during toolkit development; they are not universal constants.
Every new source must be profiled independently.

In particular, the legacy `digipal_description` model permits a description to
refer to either a historical item (`historical_item_id`) or a text (`text_id`).
The current target mapping and importer support historical-item descriptions.
Text-only descriptions and rows linked to neither entity require an explicit
policy before execution. They must not be silently discarded merely to satisfy
target constraints.

Use this source-side query during preflight:

```sql
SELECT
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE historical_item_id IS NOT NULL AND text_id IS NULL) AS historical_only,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE historical_item_id IS NULL AND text_id IS NOT NULL) AS text_only,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE historical_item_id IS NOT NULL AND text_id IS NOT NULL) AS both_links,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE historical_item_id IS NULL AND text_id IS NULL) AS neither_link
FROM digipal_description;
```

Interpret `text_only` as a valid legacy relationship needing a target mapping,
not automatically as orphaned data. Treat `neither_link` as a data-quality case
requiring source investigation or an approved quarantine/exclusion decision.

## Commands

Read-only audit to Markdown:

```bash
./scripts/backend-compose-run.sh python -m commands.audit_legacy_migration \
  --format markdown \
  --output reports/legacy-migration-audit.md
```

By default the command uses `DATABASE_URL`/`TARGET_DATABASE_URL` for the target
database. If `--target-url` is supplied and `--legacy-url` is omitted, the
legacy URL is derived by replacing only the database name with
`LEGACY_DATABASE_NAME` or the built-in generic fallback. Set both URLs
explicitly when auditing a non-standard restore or remote database.

Machine-readable audit:

```bash
./scripts/backend-compose-run.sh python -m commands.audit_legacy_migration \
  --format json \
  --output reports/legacy-migration-audit.json
```

CI-style strict audit:

```bash
./scripts/backend-compose-run.sh python -m commands.audit_legacy_migration \
  --fail-on-warning
```

Plan the write import without writing data:

```bash
./scripts/backend-compose-run.sh python -m commands.migrate_legacy_data \
  --manifest reports/legacy-migration-import-dry-run.json
```

This dry run validates the read/query and planning path only. Phase status
`ok` means the phase could be planned; it does not prove that inserts, foreign
keys, unique constraints, or the post-import audit will pass.

The dry-run manifest includes `source_profile` and `source_warnings`. Review
description relationship counts, allograph-character integrity, and legacy
publication authors before execution. Execute mode blocks before any writes when
these profile checks expose unsupported source shapes without an agreed policy.

Execute against a freshly migrated, backed-up target database:

```bash
./scripts/backend-compose-run.sh python -m commands.migrate_legacy_data --execute \
  --publication-author-username <target-author-username> \
  --allow-warnings \
  --manifest reports/legacy-migration-import-run.json
```

`<target-author-username>` must identify an existing target `auth_user`. The
command does not create that user. `--allow-warnings` permits reviewed audit
warnings but never permits a final `fail` status.

For partial trial runs, repeat `--phase`, for example:

```bash
./scripts/backend-compose-run.sh python -m commands.migrate_legacy_data --execute \
  --phase core_vocabularies \
  --phase symbols \
  --publication-author-username <target-author-username> \
  --skip-post-audit
```

## Implementation Notes

`audit_legacy_migration` remains the read-only validation layer.
`migrate_legacy_data` is the guarded write importer. It:

- Require an empty target database unless explicitly running in audit mode.
- Use transactions per phase.
- Preserve ids for id-preserved mappings.
- Refuse to proceed on unmapped required foreign keys.
- Require an explicit publication author policy.
- Save an import report/manifest and final audit output.
- Refuse to run if `legacy_url` and `target_url` point at the same database.

The importer has been smoke-tested against a disposable, freshly migrated
target database using the specific inspected legacy snapshot. The successful
trial imported all supported phases for that snapshot and ended
with audit status `warn`, not `fail`; the remaining warnings match documented
policy decisions: placeholder rows, filtered duplicate graph details, fallback
publication author mapping, and target-only data skipped from the legacy source
database. Other DigiPal sources may expose additional valid relationships or
data-quality cases that require new mappings or explicit migration policy.
